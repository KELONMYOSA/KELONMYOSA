# Hi there! <img src="https://" width="30px">

My name is Vlad Samoilenko. I'm a novice QA automation engineer. I moved into IT, taking up automation of the design of buildings and structures (BIM), by writing Dynamo + Python scripts. I am taking a course at [QA.GURU](https://qa.guru), where they teach us how to develop autotests, build infrastructure, visualize test results, and test management. You can find me on ![Telegram]()("https://t.me/KELONMYOSA")
