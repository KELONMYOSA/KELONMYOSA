# Hi there! <img src="https://github.com/KELONMYOSA/KELONMYOSA/blob/main/assets/wave.gif" width="30px">

My name is Vlad Samoilenko. I'm a novice QA automation engineer. I moved into IT, taking up automation of the design of buildings and structures (BIM), by writing Dynamo + Python scripts. 
Now I'm taking a course at [QA.GURU](https://qa.guru), where they teach us how to develop autotests, build infrastructure, visualize test results, and test management.
You can find me on [<img src="https://github.com/KELONMYOSA/KELONMYOSA/blob/main/assets/Telegram.svg" height="20px" align="center">](https://t.me/KELONMYOSA)
